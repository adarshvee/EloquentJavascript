//First Part
/*Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines.
At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
*/

    else output += "#";

/*
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program 
so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
